Greetings, I am Grayson Spidle.

I am an aspiring programmer who enjoys programming in his free time. I have dipped my toes into various realms of programming including but not limited to:
- Data Science
- Artificial Intelligence
- Combinatorics
- Parallel Programming
- High Performance Computing
- Game Development
- General Software Developement (Front and backend)

My primary languages I use are:
- C++ ([Certified](https://verify.openedg.org/?id=fHn2.BdXN.xnDM))
- Python
- Java

Languages that I know, but regret learning:
- Javascript (NodeJS)

I also am familiar with Regex and increasing my familiarity with Linux.

I believe that I will never learn everything there is to know about any of the topics/languages mentioned.
I still have much to learn and I am always looking to improve.

If you wish to contact me, use my email address displayed on my profile.
